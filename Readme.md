Diabetes Prediction using KNN
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a Diabetes Prediction System using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model is trained on medical data to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various health parameters.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, containing medical records with features such as Glucose level, BMI, Age, Insulin level, etc. The target variable indicates whether a person is diabetic (1) or not (0).
